Total hip replacement implants are used extensively to restore mobility and relieve pain caused by severe arthritis or fractures. This segment includes a variety of implants such as metal-on-polyethylene, ceramic-on-polyethylene, metal-on-metal, and ceramic-on-ceramic implants, catering to different patient needs and preferences.Total knee replacement implants represent another significant segment, addressing conditions like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis by replacing damaged knee joints with artificial implants. This segment includes implants designed for different patient anatomies and levels of activity, offering options such as fixed-bearing implants, mobile-bearing implants, and gender-specific implants. Partial hip replacement implants are used when only part of the hip joint needs replacement, providing a less invasive option compared to total hip replacements.Similarly, partial knee replacement implants target specific compartments of the knee affected by arthritis, preserving healthy tissue and facilitating quicker recovery. Revision joint replacement implants are designed for cases where previous implants fail or wear out over time, requiring replacement with more durable or advanced implants.
